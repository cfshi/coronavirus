\subhead{JD big-picture (fake subhead)}

Information related to health risks and healthy behaviour is typically generated by scientists and distilled into recommendations by public-health agencies. From there it is often transmitted by mass media to the public. Misinformation, generated by careless or irresponsible scientists, pseudo-scientists, or product-marketers can follow a similar route. In the age of the internet, these routes remain important, but the public also has easy direct access to information from public-health agencies, and to many scientific papers, including unvetted preprints. The public also has an expanded ability to interpret, transmit, and amplify messages through social media. More recently still, scientists and agencies have become active on social media as well.

During disease outbreaks of international concern, like pH1N1, WAEO ((fill in better names with dates)) or the current COVID-19 outbreak, this process is both compressed and amplified. The stakes also become higher, because public behaviour directly affects the spread of infectious disease: people who avoid large gatherings may slow disease spread, while people who flee infected areas may accelerate it, for example. Excessive fear of disease spread can have severe economic effects, and may also lead to bias and discrimination against groups seen as linked to the disease, or merely seen as others.

JD: Can we work on the diagram and this \P\ in parallel?
\mlicomment{Can we try to give a clearer defintion of ``information'' or examples of information?}
The proposed research will study how information flows between forums, including scientific publications; governmental policies and agency recommendations; and mass and social media -- and investigate how it affects public perceptions and behaviours. 
Our inter-disciplinary group will analyze these flows by combining textual and contextual analysis; AI-assisted human-supervised data mining; time-series analysis; and mathematical modeling. We will study how good information competes with misinformation, and look for factors correlated with successful spread of good information. 
We will gather information on communication and surrogates for behaviour from a wide range of sources. 
Sources about communication will include agency websites; preprint servers and publicly available scientific journals; major newspaper websites; social-media platforms; and twitter data.
Surrogates for public perceptions and behaviour will include twitter data (again); google trends; publicly available records for movie majors box office receipts; publicly available travel data; and information about cancellations and shortages (for example of face masks or pharmaceutical or pseudo-pharmaceutical products) from our textual analysis. 

\subhead{CFS detail (fake subhead)}

JD: What parts of this can be incorporated above? I am curious what \cite{BascHill20, SunYang20} actually say (it is hard to guess from the text).
\mlicomment{I think the top is fine the way it is, the text below can go to the background section.
The first page should give the overview and research question. Details, examples, and references can be in the background section.}

Success of curtailing disease outbreak depends on not only public health system, but also public adherence based on their perception of the disease.  Media have influence in swinging public perception of health issues and their estimation of health risk by framing what to present and in what context and in affecting their risk estimation, for example, overestimating rish during SARS outbreak \citep{BerrWalf07} or triggering vaccinating panic on a transmission dynamics of influenza \citep{TuchDube11}.  It can also be biased against “others” as Western newspapers portrayed Chinese during the SARS crisis \citep{HuanLeun06} (https://doi.org/10.1080/01292980500261621).  Media is also the tool public health authorities rely on to promote their concerns and recommendations during health risk outbreak.  Understanding media effect on disease spread (e.g., media attention increases self-protection) can help enhance epidemic forecasting and preventive measures to slow the disease spread \citep{KimFast19}.  

While news media (due to its online virtue) still carry their influence, social media is shaping how we communicate and understand information \citep{LiuSieg19}.  When social media undoubtedly provided benefits for public health promotion and disease prevention \cite{BascHill20, SunYang20}, for example, people using twitter for health information were merely likely to be vaccinated \citep{AhmeQuin18},  it also impose potential threats, such as discrimination, disinformation and misinformation \citep{ChouOa18, McKevanS19}.  Since the initial reports of cluster of acute severe respiratory disease (COVID-19) and the potential for global spread, there has been widespread discussion and dissemination of information through social media \citep{?}.  Twitter is a real-world disease outbreak-reporting source, and could report case outbreak ahead of official reports. \citep{YoutDara19}.  It can be used to circulate information from credible sources but also as a source of experiences and opinions \citep{ChewEyes10}.  The nature of some of the information and conversations on social media could be discriminatory and increase panic about the risk of infection. The feeling of anxiety in the population, in part can be assessed by increased demands and shortages for face masks and hand sanitizers even in countries such as Canada where only x cases confirmed to date. 

(CS:  we need a few setences about policy makers and google trend impact and roles to tie this all together)

\subhead{Research Question}
Our research questions were framed based on the object of developing potential social and policy countermeasures for COVID-19 outbreak (under the CIHR special call object).

\subsubhead{How does information (and misinformation) travel between scientists, public-health workers, mass media and social media?}
\begin{itemize}
\item{How does media cover and disseminate information?}
\item{How media content are consumed among the general public, science community and the national and international govern units?}
\end{itemize}

The aim of this question is to congregate contents to address the social and cultural dimensions of different population during the epidemic such as, examining how individuals and communities understand and react to the disease.

\subsubhead{How does communication affect public behaviour and the course of the outbreak?} 
\mlicomment{This question needs to be sharper. It is too vague and can mean different things to different people in its current form.}

This research question studies and compares the public health institutes response and guidelines and how policy affect public health behavior in reacting to the infection?
(CS: by fitting data from google trends, news and twitter and public health authority)


\subsubhead{How can scientists and policy-makers evaluate and improve the effectiveness of their communication?}
This research question aim to develop strategies to combat misinformation, stigma, and fear; and to improve public awareness and knowledge.

(CS: by comparing policy, public reaction and effectiveness (reported by public health authority and by media))

The proposed research will improved existing infomation flow by (1) curating the infomation, (2) understand how interest groups are interpreting and communication information. 
The proposed research will work to bridge the gap between theoretical advances in epidemic modelling inference, public health practice and .. with interest groups. 

\head{Background}

\mlicomment{Everything below are placeholder jargons I am copying over.}
COVID-19 is a coronavirus (CoV), that is pathogenic to humans, and the ability to directly transmit between humans has posed a significant threat and numbers compared to the previous coronavirus outbreaks: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (2002-SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (2012-MERS-CoV). 
Public health officials have reacted quickly in response to the outbreak; many researchers in the scientific community have published their preliminary analyses of the outbreak as pre-prints to estimate potential risk. 
\mlicomment{how are media/public responding to the news/preliminary analysis from the science folks? Below is how the scientist are responding.}
However, there are a lot of uncertainties in both modeling and effective control responses that can cause miscommunication between modellers and public and greatly affect control.   
\mlicomment{What do we know that is true?}
Without an effective vaccine available in time, the current control strategy is strictly quarantine and isolation and much are still unknown how effective these countermeasures are in controling the spread of the disease.  
We propose to ... and why it is useful.

\mlicomment{Maybe look at RQ.md?}

\subhead{Communication between interest groups}

\subhead{Interest group's response}

\mlicomment{again, some jargon placeholder text} 
As the COVID-19 continues to spread globally and recently annouced as the new pandemic, many researchers have published their preliminary analyses of the outbreak as pre-prints, focusing in particular on estimates of the basic reproductive number R0 and predictions.
However, estimates of R0 vary widely across from different research groups depending on the estimation methods, data and their underlying assumptions.
For example, are researchers using the same data and adaptive to changes in case-defintions (i.e., fitting window and incidence vs. cumulative cases), what assumptions are researcher using for generation interval distribution (are they using serial interval, and are they considering variation), are researchers accounting for different forms of uncertainties and heterogenetities.
These modelling choices often lead to disparate set of estimates which can lead to possible different communication messages to public health and assessment of the situation and intervention planning.

Among the COVID-19 candidate vaccines, the information available on possible candidate vaccines and the
COVID-19 epidemiology is very preliminary, no licensed vaccine currently exists and not for a long time. 
Prevention of COVID-19 transmission primarily relies on non-pharmaceutical interventions such as quarantine and isolation, which aim to prevent contact with the infectious individuals. 
The extremely high infectiousness of CoV related cases in general are in hospitals and health facilities settings makes health workers protection an important part of COVID-19 control. 
Thus, it is important to figure out the specific locations and settings cases and fatalities occur to guide effectiveness control.

\subsubhead{Media}
Newspaper will be collected from country of Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan (?), Canada and USA (and England?) based on the top circulation (either in English or Chinese)
\begin{itemize}
\item{USA: Associated Press (AP) newswire; U.S. English-language newspapers of top high-circulation; most viewed youtube (and broadcast news transcripts from top networks?).  Lexis-Nexis will be used to collect texts from the first three sources, and the MIT MediaCloud database to collect texts from websites. Texts were collected from both sources using broad search terms citep{LiuSieg19} ; and [World Journal](https://www.worldjournal.com/)}

\begin{itemize}
\item{Google Trends provides search around the world by region and county.  Research showed that Google Trend can be influenced by the media attraction than by true epidemiological burden \citep{}, yet more evidences suggested that it reflects awareness-related burst of searches citep{BousAgac17, MahrBrag19}}
\item{By analyzing google trends data, the daily infected cases and fatality and frequency of media coverage,  we use Google Search Trends and media coverage as a proxy indicator for information dissemination and public reaction

\item{The epidemic findings from science community is part of the information the public, media and international community rely on. They play a powerful role during public health crises due to the time urgency with which they can disseminate new information, accurate or not.

%(https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3536663)).  
We can also check findings of preprint (speedy information delivery, lack of peer review) in terms of accuracy and how misinformation get circulated based on those findings. (see [examples]
%(https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3536663))
}
\item{(CS’s confusion: Is context same as noise in modelling (e.g., Park and Dushoff 2020):  dynamical or process; noise(randomness directly or indirectly affecting disease transmission); observation noise(randomness underlying how many true cases reported).  Based on their definition, how do context or media, public reaction and pubic policy-guideline fit into models?  Is it a right question?)
}
\item{(CS: It will be good to incorporate modelling ideas in this project but WHAT?  Also, how workable is it to compare this coronavirus to 2012 MERS and 2002 SARS in terms of the spread and reaction context ?)
