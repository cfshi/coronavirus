	abstract = {[1. Contacts between susceptible and infectious individuals determine how fast a disease will spread. However, they are difficult to measure in the wild, and most models of disease spread have been forced to use estimated or derived values. 2. In this paper, a mathematical relationship between fox home range size and population density is derived from the literature and combined with behavioural data on movement patterns and encounters from urban Bristol, UK to formulate a predictive model of intergroup contact probabilities over a range of population densities. 3. This contact probability-population density relationship is used to formulate a revised version of the rabies model of Smith \& Harris (1991), which is the model used by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food as the basis of its rabies control policy for an outbreak of the disease in an urban area of Britain. 4. The original and revised versions of the model are compared in terms of their predictions for the rate of rabies spread and their implications for rabies control in specific urban areas. 5. An equivalent probability of successful rabies control is achieved by 5-15\% lower fox control for the revised model compared with the original one. The greatest differences between the probability of successful rabies control for a given level of fox control under the two versions of the model occur in winter. 6. The revised model predicts that the rate of rabies spread will be slower than predicted by the original model. This is due to the lower inter-group contact probabilities used in the revised model. Thus, there will be a greater chance of containment and elimination of the disease within a specified control area than was suggested by the original model. 7. The heterogeneous nature of the urban landscape probably results in a lower frequency of contacts than would be observed between foxes living at the same densities in rural environments.]},

	abstract = {Background
Over the past few decades, numerous forecasting methods have been proposed in the field of epidemic forecasting. Such methods can be classified into different categories such as deterministic vs. probabilistic, comparative methods vs. generative methods, and so on. In some of the more popular comparative methods, researchers compare observed epidemiological data from the early stages of an outbreak with the output of proposed models to forecast the future trend and prevalence of the pandemic. A significant problem in this area is the lack of standard well-defined evaluation measures to select the best algorithm among different ones, as well as for selecting the best possible configuration for a particular algorithm.

Results
In this paper we present an evaluation framework which allows for combining different features, error measures, and ranking schema to evaluate forecasts. We describe the various epidemic features (Epi-features) included to characterize the output of forecasting methods and provide suitable error measures that could be used to evaluate the accuracy of the methods with respect to these Epi-features. We focus on long-term predictions rather than short-term forecasting and demonstrate the utility of the framework by evaluating six forecasting methods for predicting influenza in the United States. Our results demonstrate that different error measures lead to different rankings even for a single Epi-feature. Further, our experimental analyses show that no single method dominates the rest in predicting all Epi-features when evaluated across error measures. As an alternative, we provide various Consensus Ranking schema that summarize individual rankings, thus accounting for different error measures. Since each Epi-feature presents a different aspect of the epidemic, multiple methods need to be combined to provide a comprehensive forecast. Thus we call for a more nuanced approach while evaluating epidemic forecasts and we believe that a comprehensive evaluation framework, as presented in this paper, will add value to the computational epidemiology community.
