# To do and discuss

## Misinformation:

-  There are so many about misinformatio and social media. What's new?
	- echo chamber:  misinformatio vs. informatio
	- does misinformation get verified or reinforced?
	- Is ther a chain of misinformation we can study?  How does it start and by what type of people/sources?  How did it get circulated?
	- What type of misinformation get mostly circulated?
	
- Is a social ecological model https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/publichealthissue/social-ecologicalmodel.html useful method as our synthesis method?

# note to ponder on
- To collect data from public transportation bureau (subway, buses in Taipei, Toronto), a good index and easier to collect ( I hope). Hotels and restaurants data.  We can compare 2018-9 vs. 19-20 vs. 20-21 during selected months.

* Agenda: public health communication flow

- Focus group:  countries, social-demo groups, 
- online survey:  instgram, twitter, tik tok 
	- different targets, different info
	- a few versions of the surveys to reduce attention span?  basic + policy/symptons/prevention and reduction/personal and social level of impact of this outbream
- news selection:  sampling, event benchmark
- comparison of recommendation and policy from governments and WHO
- Do we need ethics approval for each country? (Can I use Canada one to survey USA?)
-  ALPHA 
- Role distrubtion:
	- Nai:
	- Amy: coding book, news sampling, questionnaires of survey and focus group
	- CS:  -ditto-, ethics approval permission, finding targets,
- future ideas?

what news?  main themes?
prisoners, disadvantages groups

Lexicoder  by Mark from McGill, automated  coding software daku

african artists?  Nai.  co-production, co-creation, power relation

economic vs. health/life

(JD, ML and CF)

- decision
	* Not to include social media (e.g., WeChat)	 in China in our data analysis.  CS will write reasons why and how it won’t affect our research output.

- To do
	* How does google trend work?  
		- CS will find out how academic use it
			-  See [sleeping disorder](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6970122/#!po=5.55556), used scales; [rhinitis](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/all.13137);[skin cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5956155/),; [dengue](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154985),; [disease outbreak](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30443418); and google trend is [free for use](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en-US )
		- CS will find out how far short term data stay on the web and how to gather the information.
			- No info on Google Trend web, but others said 90 days. [Creating absolute values from Google Trends series data](https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/8x2zc8/creating_absolute_values_from_google_trends/), [Reconstruct Google Trends Daily Data for Extended Period
](https://towardsdatascience.com/reconstruct-google-trends-daily-data-for-extended-period-75b6ca1d3420) 
		- CS will propose a [search term strategy](https://havecamerawilltravel.com/photographer/google-trends-choose-keyword-search-terms/) 
		- ML will try to download the daily data once we have a search strategy
	* How does twitter work?  
		- CS will find out how does academic use twitter
	* ML will research on Baidu trends
	* CS will work on the main proposal and to explain why we don't analysis social media in China and how it would not affect our research values.
	* JD is working on inviting knowledge user on board.
	* We want a better name for the 4s (media, science, public (google trend), policy makers):  groups vs. forum vs. sections vs. communities? 
	* CS will make a google sheet of the team
