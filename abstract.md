In response to the new COVID-19 outbreak, the proposed research will investigate how information flows between scientists, public-health workers and the general public via various routes, particularly mass media and social media.

The project will be organized around three Research Questions:

- How does information (and misinformation) travel between scientists, public-health workers, mass media and social media?

- How does communication affect public behaviour and the course of the outbreak?

- How can scientists and policy-makers evaluate and improve the effectiveness of their communication?

We will analyze these flows by combining textual; AI-assisted data mining; time-series analysis; and dynamical modeling.

We are an inter-disciplinary team and will work to both strengthen understanding of community impacts and provide evidence to inform public-health responses. Our research is directly responsive to many of the research area bullet points, and particularly to the first three “Social and policy countermeasures” points.

Our scientific team is accomplished and multidisciplinary. The two principal applicants have a long history of influential research on disease outbreaks.  Our team includes computer scientists, social scientists, quantitative scientists, a epidemiologist and  statisticians. We are well connected to public health through the PAs and particularly through our BCCDC co-applicants. We also have support from PHAC and KFL&A Public Health. Finally, we are well positioned to understand the early outbreak, since our team is well connected to the emergence region, with members based in China and Taiwan, and with connections to Singapore.

Our team is ready to respond rapidly, and in fact has already started doing so. We have begun to collect twitter data, and working on curating data as well as transcribing epidemic reports released by National Health Commission of China about the epidemic.
