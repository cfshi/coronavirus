# Media and infectious disease

Success of curtailing disease outbreak depends on not only public health strategies and resources, but also public adherence based on their perception of the disease.  Media have influence in swinging public perception of health issues and their estimation of health risk by framing what to present and in what context and in affecting their risk estimation during SARS outbreak \citep{BerrWalf07} or triggering vaccinating panic on a transmission dynamics of influenza \citep{TuchDube11}.  It can also be biased against “others” as Western newspapers portrayed Chinese during the SARS crisis \citep{HuanLeun06} (https://doi.org/10.1080/01292980500261621).  Media is the tool public health authorities rely on to promote their concerns and recommendations during health risk outbreak.  Understanding media effect on disease spread (e.g., media attention increases self-protection) can help enhance epidemic forecasting and preventive measures to slow the disease spread \citep{KimFast19}.  

While news media (due to its online virtue) still carry their influence, social media is shaping how we communicate and understand information.  While social media undoubtedly provided benefits for public health promotion and disease prevention \cite{BascHill20, SunYang20}, for example, people using twitter for health information were merely likely to be vaccinated \citep{AhmeQuin18},  it also impose potential threats, such as discrimination, disinformation and misinformation \citep{McKevanS19}.  Since the initial reports of cluster of acute severe respiratory disease (COVID-19) and the potential for global spread, there has been widespread discussion and dissemination of information through social media \citep{?}.  The nature of some of the information and conversations on social media could be discriminatory and increase panic about the risk of infection. The feeling of anxiety in the population, in part can be assessed by increased demands and shortages for face masks and hand sanitizers even in countries such as Canada where only x cases confirmed to date. 

In this proposal, we plan to study media content and incorporate the findings with google trend search of the disease and official public health institution to grasp information on how the public perceive and reaction to the disease and how the these forums interrelate with each other in disseminating the information and change behaviours.  It will help us to uncover a better communication network for an effective public health surveillance and understanding of how disease means not only than just epidemic, but also socially and politically.

# Call for proposals (due __18 Feb__)

[Canadian Institutes of Health Research Novel Coronavirus Rapid Research Funding Opportunity](https://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/51868.html)

[proposal evaluation](https://www.researchnet-recherchenet.ca/rnr16/vwOpprtntyDtls.do?prog=3248#evaluation) 

We intend to focus on the following proposed topic areas
- Social and policy countermeasures research
	- (Object 1) Studying social and cultural dimensions of the epidemic such as, examining how individuals and communities understand and react to the disease;
	- (Object 2) Studying national and international public health institutes response and guidelines aiming to contain COVID-19 and to mitigates its secondary impacts, such as quarantines, supply shortages and racism.
	- (Object 3) Developing strategies to combat misinformation, stigma, and fear; and to improve public awareness and knowledge

# Draft title suggestions

* How information on news and social media about COVID-19 travels between interest groups and affects public behaviour
	- We need a better title. CS feels “interest groups” is not solid nor attractive enough

* How information about COVID-19 travels across the public, media, science community and policy makers and affects public behaviour
	- It’s a bit long to show those 4 forums, but…
