# Call for proposals (due __18 Feb__)

[Canadian Institutes of Health Research Novel Coronavirus Rapid Research Funding Opportunity](https://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/51868.html)

[proposal evaluation](https://www.researchnet-recherchenet.ca/rnr16/vwOpprtntyDtls.do?prog=3248#evaluation) 

We intend to focus on the following proposed topic areas
- Social and policy countermeasures research
	- (Object 1) Studying social and cultural dimensions of the epidemic such as, examining how individuals and communities understand and react to the disease;
	- (Object 2) Studying national and international public health institutes response and guidelines aiming to contain COVID-19 and to mitigates its secondary impacts, such as quarantines, supply shortages and racism.
	- (Object 3) Developing strategies to combat misinformation, stigma, and fear; and to improve public awareness and knowledge

# Draft title suggestions

* How information on news and social media about COVID-19 travels between interest groups and affects public behaviour
	- We need a better title. CS feels “interest groups” is not solid nor attractive enough

* How information about COVID-19 travels across the public, media, science community and policy makers and affects public behaviour
	- It’s a bit long to show those 4 forums, but…

# Methods:
-  Data mining:
	* textual analysis of news media and Twitter are implemented by AI based on coding book which will be based on a pilot study.  The findings of textual analysis 
		- Human Coders and AI (?):  
			- (fill in what it is about	)
			- ( fill in sentences on AI part)
			- (fill in sentences on coders)
			- The textual analysis will be conducted based on a coding book we will draft when the funding is approved.  The coding book should list themes and frames for analyzing the texts, which will be categorized based on a pilot study as part of drawing the coding book.  The basic structure of the themes will outline what (e.g. ), in addition to information types  (e.g., news, information and misinformation/fake news based on sources: verified, anonymous, speculation), who (e.g. active vs. passive subject), where (e.g., country, region and city), and theme tone (e.g., negative, positive, neutral).  (see  attached [Basic Coding frame](https://github.com/cfshi/coronavirus/blob/master/coding%20book.md) for what themes are like)
- Contextual analysis by researchers
	- (fill in what contextual analysis is)
	-   How media content and information are framed are often socially and politically cultivated \cite{}.  We will  implement contextual analyses of the quantitative findings and elaborate how information is framed and disseminated in this uncertain circumstances into context.
	- summarizing and comparing policy, guidelines and recommendation by national and international health organizations.
- modelling (Can we do this?_:  incorporating media coverage, public and institutional reaction and report (which can be based on modelling results by scientific community and WHO etc), time travelling and spread network (geographical)
	
	* key words search for Google trend analysis, and official public health websites: coronavirus, 19-nCov, COVID-19, influenza, 武疫 (Wu Virus)，武漢病毒 (Wuhan Virus)，武漢(Wuhan)，武漢肺炎 (Wuhan pneumonia)，肺炎 (pneumonia)，冠状病毒 (coronavirus), 新型冠状病毒 (novel coronavirus), 武漢新型冠状病毒 (Wuhan novel coronavirus)
-  general public:
	- Data:  travel, [movies](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/?ref_=bo_nb_di_mojologo), restaurants in Taiwan, Singapore, H.K., Canada and USA; or should we focus on North America and on travel and [movie box office](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/?ref_=bo_nb_di_mojologo)?
