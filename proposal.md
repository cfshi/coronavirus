# Call for proposals (due __18 Feb__)

[Canadian Institutes of Health Research Novel Coronavirus Rapid Research Funding Opportunity](https://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/51868.html)

We intend to focus on the following proposed topic areas
- Social and policy countermeasures research
	- Cultural dimensions of the epidemic such as, examining how individuals and communities understand and react to the disease;
	- Studying the public health response;
	- Developing strategies to combat misinformation, stigma, and fear;


# Draft title suggestions

* Whispering down the lane: how information about COVID-19 travels across forums and affects public behaviour
	- CF:  I like this title.  Although it is argued that public behaviours affect how information is framed.  Plus it is hard to evaluate this cause-effect relationship.

* Mapping 2020 novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak trend: media coverage, the public reaction and understanding and governmental and international response

# Research Questions:

- How does information (and misinformation) travel between scientists, public-health workers, mass media and social media? 

* How does communication affect public behaviour and the course of the outbreak? What are the side effects of changes in public behaviour? 

* How policy correlate with health behavior in contributing/reducing/avoiding the infection?

* How can scientists and policy-makers evaluate and improve the effectiveness of their communication?

# Resources

-  Google Trend data.  By analyzing google trends data, the daily infected cases and fatality and frequency of media coverage,  we use Google Search Trends and media coverage as a proxy indicator for information dissemination and public reaction  (https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3536663).
		
* Science community report Ro of the virus transmission.  The epidemic findings is part of the information the public, media and international community rely on. They play a powerful role during public health crises due to the time urgency with which they can disseminate new information, accurate or not. (ref: [Early in the Epidemic: Impact of preprints on global discourse of 2019-nCoV transmissibility](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3536663)).  We can also check findings of preprint (speedy information delivery, lack of peer review) in terms of accuracy and how misinformation get circulated based on those findings. (see [examples](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3536663))
		
* Official websites to analyze social and policy countermeasures.  How does the national and international community react to the disease outbreak and with what guidelines (analyzing official websites, such as WHO, CDC, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, etc)

We will compare policies and recommendations to contain and prevent the spread of the disease in selected countries.  
		* Although WHO position in the beginning of the virus spread was [questioned](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/chinese-officials-note-serious-problems-in-coronavirus-response-the-world-health-organization-keeps-praising-them/2020/02/08/b663dd7c-4834-11ea-91ab-ce439aa5c7c1_story.html) , how to interpret WHO information and recommendation need to be cautious.  (It can be another interesting direction of comparison.)

(Chyun’s confusion: Is context same as noise in modelling (e.g., Park and Dushoff 2020):  dynamical or process; noise(randomness directly or indirectly affecting disease transmission); observation noise(randomness underlying how many true cases reported).  Based on their definition, how do context or media, public reaction and pubic policy-guideline fit into models?  Is it a right question?)

- It will be good to incorporate modeling ideas in this project but WHAT?  Also, how workable is it to compare this coronavirus to 2012 MERS and 2002 SARS in terms of the spread and reaction context ?

# Coronavirus spread timeline and area:

  - [outbreak timeline](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/01/timeline-china-coronavirus-spread-200126061554884.html?xif=%20and%20https:/www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/01/cloneofcloneofcloneofchina-battles-coronavirus-o-200129233906291.html)
  - [countries affected](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/22/where-has-coronavirus-spread)

# Data and Methods: 
(ref theme analysis in the H1N1 paper, and PMID: 31956275)
-  media (big data mining?)
Top newspaper, twitters and youtube (hope to have data of TV content, but seems not easy.)
	* Media in
		- USA: 
Associated Press (AP) newswire; U.S. English-language newspapers of top high-circulation; most viewed youtube (and broadcast news transcripts from top networks?).  Lexis-Nexis will be used to collect texts from the first three sources, and the MIT MediaCloud database to collect texts from websites. Texts were collected from both sources using broad search terms \cite{LiuSieg19} 
		- Canada: (similar to USA)
		- Taiwan: https://www.ncl.edu.tw/.
		- Hong Kong
		- China
		- Singapore
		- How do we collect public data in China (We Chat or?)

	* key words search: coronavirus, 19-nCov, COVID-19, influenza, 武疫，武漢病毒，武漢，武漢肺炎，肺炎，新型冠状病毒, 武漢新型冠状病毒

	* theme of analysis (which should be based on a pilot study):  
		- resources: face mask, vaccine, quarantine, flight, death toll, politics, 
		- health concern and treatment:
		- human relations (humanity):  family, friends, community (e.g., how they support each other or fight for resources) in supermarket, neighbourhood, online support or in a cruise, etc
		- policy and action:  quarantine, grounding flights, entry to countries, evacuation out of China (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-masks-safety/to-mask-or-not-to-mask-confusion-spreads-over-coronavirus-protection-idUSKBN1ZU0PH)
		- guidance:  how to wear face mask,  travel recommondation,  
		- flu symptom:
		- coronavirus characteristics: what it is and compared to other diseases
		- fear and stigma: (e.g., https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/world/asia/china-coronavirus-korea-discrimination.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)
		- conspiracy theory:  e.g., P4 lab in Wuhan
		- fatality and infected cases:
		- sanction of information about the disease inside China (e.g., https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/02/04/chinese-doctor-has-coronavirus/)
		- human interest:  heroes, victims, personal stories, etc
		- distrust:  among people, communities, countries etc
		- economic impact
		- international relations, global coordination, response systems and crisis management
	* information-news sources
		- verified
		- anonymous
		- speculation
	* Who
		- active subject
		- passive subject
	* Where
		- country, region and city

	* Attribute theme weight:  Based on which paragraph key concept (via words) appear.  For example, 3 points to that in the first 3 paragraphs, 2 to 4-6 and 1 to the afterwards.

	* We will do a contextual analysis based on the quantitative findings.

-  general public:
	- Google Trend 
		- e.g. https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%201-m&geo=SG&q=%2Fm%2F01cpyy,wuhan%20virus,19-nCov,sars,flu ,([export google trend data]( https://support.google.com/trends/answer/4365538?hl=en)
		- Google Trend data can be very confusing, for [example](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%201-m&geo=TW&gprop=images&q=coronavirus,sars,%2Fm%2F0l3cy,wuhan%20virus,%E6%AD%A6%E6%BC%A2%E8%82%BA%E7%82%8E)): Why would Wuhan topped coronavirus and 武漢肺炎 in Taiwan?
- science, review of R0 publication from Dec 2019-present 
- governmental and international sites: 
	* WHO, [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/index.html), [National Health Commission of PRC](http://en.nhc.gov.cn/index.html) etc

* modelling:  incorporating media coverage, public and institutional reaction and report (which can be based on modelling results by scientific community and WHO etc), time travelling and spread network (geographical)
