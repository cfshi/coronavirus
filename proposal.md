# Call for proposals (due __18 Feb__)

[Canadian Institutes of Health Research Novel Coronavirus Rapid Research Funding Opportunity](https://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/51868.html)

[proposal evaluation](https://www.researchnet-recherchenet.ca/rnr16/vwOpprtntyDtls.do?prog=3248#evaluation) 

We intend to focus on the following proposed topic areas
- Social and policy countermeasures research
	- (Object 1) Studying social and cultural dimensions of the epidemic such as, examining how individuals and communities understand and react to the disease;
	- (Object 2) Studying national and international public health institutes response and guidelines aiming to contain COVID-19 and to mitigates its secondary impacts, such as quarantines, supply shortages and racism.
	- (Object 3) Developing strategies to combat misinformation, stigma, and fear; and to improve public awareness and knowledge

# Draft title suggestions

* How information about COVID-19 travels between interest groups and affects public behaviour
	- We need a better title. CS feels “interest groups” is not solid nor attractive enough

* How information about COVID-19 travels across the public, media, science community and policy makers and affects public behaviour
	- It’s a bit long to show those 4 forums, but…

# Research Questions:

Our research questions were framed based on the object of developing potential social and policy countermeasures for COVID-19 outbreak (under the CIHR special call object).

1. (RQ1) How does information (and misinformation) travel between scientists, public-health workers, mass media and social media? This research question addresses the social and cultural dimensions of different population during the epidemic such as, examining how individuals and communities understand and react to the disease (Object 1)

2.  (RQ2) How does communication affect public behaviour and the course of the outbreak?  This research question studies and compares the public health institutes response and guidelines and how policy affect public health behavior in reacting to the infection? (Object 2)

3.  (RQ3) How can scientists and policy-makers evaluate and improve the effectiveness of their communication? This research question aim to develop strategies to combat misinformation, stigma, and fear; and to improve public awareness and knowledge (Object 3)

# Data and Sources: 
(ref theme analysis in the H1N1 paper, and PMID: 31956275)
Data published from November, 2019 to present (or one or two month after the outbreak waned)

- print news media (big data mining?)
- social media:	
	*YouTube:  Canada, USA, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore

For contextual-discourse analysis, we will add sources (e.g., [Central China Normal Univeristy](http://news.ccnu.edu.cn/index.htm), []Wuhan University(https://www.whu.edu.cn/xxfy/) etc for our contextual analysis.


Main newspapers in China and their official health bureau websites are included for analysis but not social media.   Social media such as twitter and Facebook are barred in China. Yet, there are information and coverage about the outbreak inside China in the media we analyze either from direct interview or re-twittes. 
		
* Science community report Ro of the virus transmission.  The epidemic findings is part of the information the public, media and international community rely on. They play a powerful role during public health crises due to the time urgency with which they can disseminate new information, accurate or not. (ref: [Early in the Epidemic: Impact of preprints on global discourse of 2019-nCoV transmissibility](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3536663)).  We can also check findings of preprint (speedy information delivery, lack of peer review) in terms of accuracy and how misinformation get circulated based on those findings. (see [examples](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3536663))
		
* Official websites to analyze social and policy countermeasures.  How does the national and international community react to the disease outbreak and with what guidelines (analyzing official websites, such as WHO, CDC, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, etc)
 

(CS’s confusion: Is context same as noise in modelling (e.g., Park and Dushoff 2020):  dynamical or process; noise(randomness directly or indirectly affecting disease transmission); observation noise(randomness underlying how many true cases reported).  Based on their definition, how do context or media, public reaction and pubic policy-guideline fit into models?  Is it a right question?)

(CS: It will be good to incorporate modelling ideas in this project but WHAT?  Also, how workable is it to compare this coronavirus to 2012 MERS and 2002 SARS in terms of the spread and reaction context ?)

# Methods:
- Data collection

We will collect data of the following dated from November, 2019 till present (?).
	- Newspaper will be collected from country of Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan (?), Canada and USA (and England?) based on the top circulation (either in English or Chinese)
		- USA: Associated Press (AP) newswire; U.S. English-language newspapers of top high-circulation; most viewed youtube (and broadcast news transcripts from top networks?).  Lexis-Nexis will be used to collect texts from the first three sources, and the MIT MediaCloud database to collect texts from websites. Texts were collected from both sources using broad search terms \cite{LiuSieg19} ; and [World Journal](https://www.worldjournal.com/)
		- Canada: (similar to USA), and [Sing Tao Daily](https://www.singtao.ca/toronto/?variant=zh-hk)
		- Taiwan: the top x newspapers. https://www.ncl.edu.tw/.
		- Hong Kong: [Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/gb/news415.htm),
		- China:  [The People’s Daily English](http://en.people.cn/), [The People’s Daily English](http://www.people.com.cn/), [China Daily](http://global.chinadaily.com.cn/)		- Singapore
		- Japan: [Japanese Times](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/)
	- Twitter: (CS:  How does it work internationally outside Canada and USA?).  It will be great if we can have social media (instgram or FB in Taiwan, Singapore etc)
	- Google Trend database.  Google Trends provides search around the world by region and county.  Research showed that Google Trend can be influenced by the media attraction than by true epidemiological burden \cite{}, yet more evidences suggested that it reflects awareness-related burst of searches \cite{BousAgac17, MahrBrag19}
		-   By analyzing google trends data, the daily infected cases and fatality and frequency of media coverage,  we use Google Search Trends and media coverage as a proxy indicator for information dissemination and public reaction  (https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3536663).
		- e.g. https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%201-m&geo=SG&q=%2Fm%2F01cpyy,wuhan%20virus,19-nCov,sars,flu ,([export google trend data]( https://support.google.com/trends/answer/4365538?hl=en)
		- Google Trend data can be very confusing, for [example](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%201-m&geo=TW&gprop=images&q=coronavirus,sars,%2Fm%2F0l3cy,wuhan%20virus,%E6%AD%A6%E6%BC%A2%E8%82%BA%E7%82%8E)): Why would Wuhan topped coronavirus and 武漢肺炎 in Taiwan?
	- science, review of R0 publication from Dec 2019-present: - Science publication: preprint (by searching Google Scholar, arXiv, bioRxiv, medRxiv, and SSRN) and peer-reviewed (by search Google Schoolar, PubMed, Embase, Medline, and OVID)
	-  Official health websites:  WHO, [US CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/index.html), [National Health Commission of PRC](http://en.nhc.gov.cn/index.html), [Canada PHAC](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection.html), [Taiwan CDC](https://www.cdc.gov.tw/En), [Singapore CDC](https://www.ncid.sg/Pages/default.aspx), [Hong Kong CDC]().  We will include the disease control and prevention centre in Japan later if 

-  Data mining:
	- textual analysis by AI based on coding book which will be based on a pilot study)
	- Contextual analysis by researchers
	- summarizing and comparing policy, guidelines and recommendation by national and international health organitions
	
* modelling:  incorporating media coverage, public and institutional reaction and report (which can be based on modelling results by scientific community and WHO etc), time travelling and spread network (geographical)
- Coding Book and Guideline 
	* Human Coders and AI (?) will be based on a coding book (see attached for some basic ideas)
	* key words search for
		- Google trend, and official public health websites: coronavirus, 19-nCov, COVID-19, influenza, 武疫 (Wu Virus)，武漢病毒 (Wuhan Virus)，武漢(Wuhan)，武漢肺炎 (Wuhan pneumonia)，肺炎 (pneumonia)，冠状病毒 (coronavirus), 新型冠状病毒 (novel coronavirus), 武漢新型冠状病毒 (Wuhan novel coronavirus)

The textual analysis will be conducted based on a coding book we will draft when the funding is approved.  The coding book should list themes and frames for analyzing the texts, which will be categorized based on a pilot study as part of drawing the coding book.  The basic structure of the themes will outline what (e.g. ), in addition to information types  (e.g., news, information and misinformation/fake news based on sources: verified, anonymous, speculation), who (e.g. active vs. passive subject), where (e.g., country, region and city), and theme tone (e.g., negative, positive, neutral).  (see  attached [Basic Coding frame](https://github.com/cfshi/coronavirus/blob/master/coding%20book.md) for what themes are like)

We will do textual and contextual analyses based on the quantitative results to elaborate how information is framed and disseminated in this uncertain 

-  general public:
	- Data:  travel, [movies](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/?ref_=bo_nb_di_mojologo), restaurants in Taiwan, Singapore, H.K., Canada and USA; or should we focus on North America and on travel and [movie box office](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/?ref_=bo_nb_di_mojologo)?
