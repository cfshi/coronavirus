- line 5: What process?  You haven't specified one.
- line 10: What does "seen as others" mean?
- line 25: Maybe add acronym defn:  "...three Research Questions (RQs):"
- lines 27,30,32: Put "Research sub-area" in italics and end with a colon.
- line 30: "public health response" isn't right.  Perhaps something like "Behavioural responses and effects on outbreaks"?  btw, my various papers combining game theory and epi modelling are relevant to this question:

- line 36: "infectious outbreak" --> "infectious disease outbreak"
- line 46: "It's" --> "It is".  avoid contractions.
- line 46: "have strong influence on" --> "strongly influence"
- line 50: "during health risk outbreak" --> "during outbreaks".  Also "effect" --> "effects".
- line 55: "increasing role" --> "increasingly important role"
- line 57: "cluster" --> "a cluster"
- line 73: "20" --> "2020"
- line 79: "pages" --> "web pages"
- line 82: "December" --> "December 2019"
- line 84: "USA" --> "the USA"
- line 87: "2020" --> "2019"
- line 90: missing space after comma
- line 100: "randomly subset" --> "randomly selected subset"
- line 128: "Contextual analysis will be studied by the researchers."  That says nothing to me. I suspect you meant something else. If you meant "conducted" rather than "studied" then it would make more sense to me, but would be completely unnecessary to state.
- line 129: "implement" --> "conduct" (?)
- line 131: "in this uncertain circumstances into context".  I don't understand this phrase.
- line 132: "it can be insufficient in understanding what contents connote" --> "it can be insufficient to explain the connotations of textual content" (?)  The rest of this paragraph needs to be cleaned up grammatically.  I'm hesitant to try to do that because I am not sure I understand what is being proposed.
- line 145: Perhaps combine the tweets with a blog, which would engage different audiences.  The tweets could summarize more elaborate blog posts.  I have no experience writing either a blog or tweets myself...
- line 148: "outbreak" --> "outbreaks"
- line 151: ref 33 does not exist.  There are only 12 refs.
- line 152: you could add something along the lines of ", including modelling the influence of individual decision-making on epidemic dynamics".
- line 229 (figure).  Does the media not influence policymakers? They may not want to admit it, but I bet it does.  Reality might contain a dashed arrow from Media to Policymaker.  Evidence for such effects is something that the methodology could address perhaps.
- obviously the later sections and figure captions need a lot of attention.
- feels like a fascinating project -- hopefully reviewers will agree.
