# Knowledge Translation $47 000

To enhance our ability to share information, we have budgeted for 4 open-access publications over 2 years at ~$3500 per article and two scientific meetings for up to three team members each to participate at ~$5000/per meeting.

Two team members will attend the annual CIHR meetings at a cost of ~$3000/per meeting.

We have budgeted $15000 to organize a group meeting after one year for researchers and knowledge users involved in the grant.
