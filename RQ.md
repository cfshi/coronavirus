# Pipelining

We have to identify what the big picture is, what are the problems, what can we do to help. Start by assuming we have all the data in the world, how are the _forums_ processing these information?

Try not get too hung up on sources. It is a problem, limitation and we are going to acknowledge it.

# Research Questions

## How does information (and misinformation) travel between scientists, public-health workers, mass media and social media? 

- What is information? How are we defining what informations are?
- Once we have a clear defintion of what _information_ is, do we really mean _misinformation_ or _miscommunication_?
- MLi thinks information is concrete, and misinformation is introduced into the flow via miscommunication or intentional misinformation. 

## How does communication affect public behaviour and the course of the outbreak? What are the side effects of changes in public behaviour? 

- Communication is basically the black arrows in the flow diagram.

## How policy correlate with health behavior in contributing/reducing/avoiding the infection?

- The effects of each arrow. 
	

## How can scientists and policy-makers evaluate and improve the effectiveness of their communication?

- Curating information
