# Pipelining

We have to identify what the big picture is, what are the problems, what can we do to help. Start by assuming we have all the data in the world, how are the _forums_ processing these information?

Try not get too hung up on sources. It is a problem, a limitation and we are going to acknowledge it and do what we can. (I will come back to this later)

# Research Questions

## How does information (and misinformation) travel between scientists, public-health workers, mass media and social media? 

- What is information? How are we defining what informations are?
	- We can start by really, conceptually think about what information means for each party (science, policy makers, media and public). 
	- We know a lot what scientist wants to know and what information we want and what information we can provide (See mli_communication diagram). Communicating within scientist (uncertainties) and more importantly to the other parties is a challenge. Think of it as homogeneous communication (within party) and heterogeneous communication (to others).
	- We *think* we know what public health and policy makers want to know and what information they need. This is the two-headed arrow in science and policy makers: What do the policy makers want from us so they can make decision and tell the other parties.
	- What info does the Media and Public want to know, how are they going to react.

- Once we have a clear defintion of what _information_ is and what everyone want, we can further classify infomation to (effective info, what we need to answer questions/actions) and ineffective/misinformation. 

## How does communication affect public behaviour and the course of the outbreak? What are the side effects of changes in public behaviour? 

- Communication is basically the black arrows in the flow diagram. 
- Are we on the same page in the agenda?
- How are people/each party responding to information coming out (on the receving end of the diagram)?

## How policy correlate with health behavior in contributing/reducing/avoiding the infection?

- The effects of each arrow. 
	

## How can scientists and policy-makers evaluate and improve the effectiveness of their communication?

- Curating information

Once we know roughly how it works in the perfect world, we can start factoring in data-sources and how people are getting their information. Compare the information we want and what we are actually getting. How does it complicate and change the communication flow. What are the ramifications?
