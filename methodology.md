The public, traditional media, social media, public policy makers, Google Trend (in-between/among the other four forums)
We will try to conduct focus group and online survey BEFORE the social distancing lift.  It might be hard but the information will be more prompt than replying on memory.

# Focus group (via Zoom etc): 
- Why do we need this?  To elaborate how people think and react to this virus.
  - There are also concerns that media dissemination and consumption can be overwhelmed and dissensitize.
- Where:  Taiwan, Toronto, (ideally also Singapore, HK, Korea, US, Italy and other IMIC (low to middle income countries).
- Who:  senior citizens (senior home), youth, health practitionres?


# [Online Survey](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1laEd1aGx8mWPhfwYaM9Wa3ys2NF91eMpkANmlR9iw20/edit) (Tik Tok, instgram, twitter and FB):
- define age groups
- Should we conduct a few different themes for different groups, so it won't take too long since it's online?  Also, we might get a more detailed info if not too many themes to talk about. Testing, social distancing, policies, herd immunity, mask, hand washing, etc.  E.g., [timeline in Ontario](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cL13xouKC--IPH2Yyot5pF8JjavepSly/view)

# Content Analysis/frame/thematic...of news media  WHICH ONE?
We have to revise the sample selection.  Instead of using AI running through each single article, we will do samples. (due to fudning)

# Textual Analysis (data mining):

To explain differnces of users by their socio demographics of the following: 
* Twitter
* Instgram
* FB

# Goolge Trend (data mining)
* We need to be clear about how we use search keywords e.g.,[terms vs. topics](https://support.google.com/trends/answer/4359550?hl=en).  For example, we got different results of coronavirus (as a topic) vs. coronavirus as a search term.
* main search terms:  coronavirus, COVID-19, social distancing, asymptomatic, flatten the curve, face mask

# Public Health Data:

# Data on public events and individual behavior change:
* [movie box office](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/calendar/?ref_=bo_nb_in_tab)
* [pubic transportation:  daily ride of subway, buses]() (Although people might take cabs instead to avoid close human contact)
* [water meter: do people spend more time home?]()
* [utility meter](), 
* [Blue Dot-flights etc](https://bluedot.global/products/)
* Although data like grocery shopping, food stocking can be interesting, but it is more a side question to our RQs.  The behavioral change is like a chain, starting from worrying about getting sick (buying face masks, no hand shaking, not going to movies etc) to stock up food, selling stocks etc to reduct its non medical impact.

# Others
* Need to make a theme and timeline
