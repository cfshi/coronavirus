# Textual Analysis (data mining):

To explain differnces of users by their socio demographics of the following: 
* Twitter
* Instgram
* FB

# Goolge Trend (data mining)
* We need to be clear about how we use search keywords e.g.,[terms vs. topics](https://support.google.com/trends/answer/4359550?hl=en).  For example, we got different results of coronavirus (as a topic) vs. coronavirus as a search term.
* Also see [MLi's code[(https://github.com/cfshi/coronavirus/blob/master/google_trend.rmd)

# Public Health Data:
* Collecting governement and WHO update, guideliens and recommondations: CDC of Canada, USA, Italy, Korea, China, Singapore, Japan, Taiwan; WHO
* [daily case track](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)
* CDC seasonal flu clinic visits over years (to compare if people got pre-cautious about COVID-19 from Dec, 2019-.

# Data on public events and individual behavior change:
* [movie box office](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/calendar/?ref_=bo_nb_in_tab)
* [pubic transportation:  daily ride of subway, buses]() (Although people might take cabs instead to avoid close human contact)
* [water meter: do people spend more time home?]()
* [utility meter](), 
* [Blue Dot-flights etc](https://bluedot.global/products/)
* Although data like grocery shopping, food stocking can be interesting, but it is more a side question to our RQs.  The behavioral change is like a chain, starting from worrying about getting sick (buying face masks, no hand shaking, not going to movies etc) to stock up food, selling stocks etc to reduct its non medical impact.

# Others
* Need to make a theme and timeline
