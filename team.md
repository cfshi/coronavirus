## Levels

The levels are:
* Principal Applicant (or Nominated Principal Applicant)
* Co-Applicant
* Collaborator

There are also Knowledge Users (and Principal Knowledge Users). These tend to be more applied people; it would be nice to look for one.

## Rules

[How to apply](https://www.researchnet-recherchenet.ca/rnr16/vwOpprtntyDtls.do?printfriendly=true&prog=3248#howtoapply). The Eligibility link is boring: David is eligible and we are not going to qualify for LMIC funding

It looks like applicants, co-applicants and knowledge users need
* CIHR pin
* Diversity statement
* CV
	* It says on the howtoapply link that it doesn't need to be a Common CV, but I'm scared of researchnet; we should experiment with this
