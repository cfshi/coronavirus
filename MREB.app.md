# 3.4 How would you describe the research activity conducted in this protocol to a lay person unfamiliar with your discipline's methodologies and jargon? (max 250 words)?

The COVID-19 Awareness Study is an online anonymous survey conducted by McMaster University.   
We will collect data on the public's knowledge about the COVID-19 outbreak, and their behavioural responses. 
Data will be used to help us better understand patterns of health knowledge and response to this crisis, with the goal of learning how to improve health communication during a disease outbreak.


# 8/1 Describe concisely and in plain language the study background of the proposed research project (e.g., context of the research, previous research, importance of this area of study, etc.).

Effective communication during health crises is crucial as past outbreaks (e.g., SARS and H1N1) have revealed. The interactions between health communication and public behaviour are critical for control of COVID-19 and have not yet been fully studied.  Understanding public attitudes, disease knowledge, and behaviour has the potential to help us improve the control strategies for the current COVID-19 pandemic and future epidemics.

# 8.2 Describe concisely and in plain language the specific purpose / research question for the proposed study.
The primary goal of this study is to characterize what COVID-19 knowledge the public has and the pattern of responses to the pandemic in relation to the government policy.  There are two main question areas in this proposed study:
* What are people’s knowledge of COVID-19?
* How are people behaving in response to COVID-19 and government's policy of controlling the outbreak?

__JD__: Do we need to ask people about the guidance present in their jurisdiction (country, state or province)? Are we planning to look at their answers in the light of the jurisdiction that they are in? If a person is from a place where the rules are different should we interpret their behaviour differently?

__CS__ That's a good question.  My thought is to analyse data based on country they live within the last 6 months.  We can ask for zip code but I'm afraid it will get too complicated beyond my (our) ability to parse.  Analyses at a national level might not be perfect but I feel it should give us a good picture.  Does that make sense statistically?


# 9.1 What is the approximate number of participants required for this study? 
_Where applicable, also provide a rationale for your choice in sample size 
and/or the sample size calculation (e.g., to explain how a low sample size 
will still provide meaningful results, or to justify the number of participants 
needed in research that includes significant risks)._

We will aim to recruit at least 1,000 people . Since we have limited control over who will participate online, a larger number will better allow us to investigate and compensate for biases.

# 9.2 What are the salient participant characteristics (e.g., age, gender, location, affiliation, etc.)? 
_Describe any specific inclusion/exclusion criteria (e.g., BMI > 30, immigrated to Canada in the past year, etc.)_

The survey is anonymous and will not collect any identifiable personal information.  No limitations will be placed on gender, race, health status or other socio-demographic factors. The proposed study population is age 13 or older.  This is an online study and we aim to circulate the survey via social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.  The minimum age to obtain an account on those social media platforms is 13.  It is important to include all users of these platforms so we can capture data from teenagers, whose lives are strongly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Understanding their awareness of the pandemic and responses to it will be valuable in managing health risk communication.

We believe the adolescents of age 13 and older have the capacity to understand the study, and the risks involved, and to provide their own consent.

__CS__ Please take a look of the age statement.  I changed it from age 16 to age 13.  I hope it won't be an issue based on the email exchange with Karen of MREB.  The worse scenario will be changed it back to age 16.

__DE__ Revised a bit.

# 10.1 How will each type of participant be recruited?

Recruitment messages will be posted online on public platform of various social media with a link to the anonymous survey questionnaire. 

# 10.2 Who will recruit each type of participant?

The team investigators will be in charge of the recruitment plan and post the message on social media. 
We will encourage social media users to circulate the recruitment message further.

# 11.1 Describe sequentially, and in detail all data collection procedures in which the research participants will be involved 
_(e.g., paper and pencil tasks, interviews, focus groups, lab experiments, participant observation, surveys, physical assessments etc. —this is not an exhaustive list). Include information about who will conduct the research (include tasks done by assistants, translators, transcriptionists etc.), how long it will take, where data collection will take place, and the ways in which data will be collected (e.g., computer responses, handwritten notes, audio/video/photo recordings etc.)._

Potential participants will first read the study summary and information, and consent terms.  Once they decide to proceed and agree with the terms, they will start the survey.  The potential participants are informed that they can stop participation at any time during the survey.  When they complete the survey, the information they provide will be stored automatically and safely on cloud storage.  The whole survey will take about 15 minutes.

# 11.2 Describe your data analysis methods, (e.g. statistical analysis, textual analysis, NVIVO, etc.)?

We will collect only easily categorizable responses, and will study with standard descriptive and inferential statistical methods.

# 14.4	Provide the following;
a) Description of the potential psychological risk(s).
b) Explanation of how the psychological risk(s) will be managed or minimized.
c) If the study includes significant psychological risk, then explain why alternative approaches with less psychological risk cannot be used.

There are no conceivable psychological risks.  There may be some minimal risks from participating in this survey. Some of the topics inquired in this study may be sensitive.

# 14.18 Discuss any potential benefits to the participants, scientific community and/or society that justify involvement of participants in this study.

Participants will not directly benefit from this study. However, we hope that information we gather about health communication will provide indirect benefits to the larger population.

# 14.19 What is your experience with this kind of research? Include information on the experience of all individual(s) who will have contact with the research participants or their data. If this is student research, include the experience of your supervisor. Mention your familiarity with:

(a) the proposed methods
(b) the study population(s) and/or
(c) the research topic.

Dr. Earn and Dr. Dushoff are both prominent disease modellers and statisticians and will supervise the study and data analysis. 
Dr. Shi holds a doctoral degree in media and communication study.  Dr. Shi also obtained a certificate of TCPS2: Course on Research Ethics tutorial in 2020.
Dr. Li, a well-trained statistician, will assist data analysis.

# 15.11.14 Describe the data security procedures that will be used to keep the research data private and secure during data collection and analysis (including where the data will be kept). Refer to the MREB Data Storage and Security Tools documents for recommendations and requirements for data security (go to Help - Templates in the above menu).

The TCPS2 advises that identifiable data obtained through research, and kept on a computer that is connected to the Internet, should be encrypted. Generally, MREB requires researchers to follow this guidance for identifiable research data. In some cases, sensitive identifiable data, even if not on a device connected to the Internet, may need to be encrypted to protect participant privacy and mitigate social risk. See the application section of Art. 5.3.

No personally identifiable data will be collected at any time. The electronic database will be stored on a password protected cloud storage.  

# 15.19 How will the data from study participants be reported in the dissemination of research results (e.g., aggregated data, identifiable descriptors, de-identified descriptors, etc.)?

The data to be collected will be anonymous.  Only aggregated data will be reported. 

# 15.23 State how long you plan to retain your research data (e.g., interview transcripts, survey answers, EEG readings, etc.).

The electronic database will be kept indefinitely.

# 15.24 Provide the rationale for the retention length of research data.

There is nothing sensitive about our data, so it is better to retain them in case problems need to be checked or new data become available for comparison. 

# 15.36 Provide the details of sharing the data (e.g. the specific database), the rationale for making your raw data available, and describe the nature of the data that will be made available (e.g., identifiable or not, which variables). Be sure to include these details in the Letter of Information so participants consent to this sharing of data. 

The aggregated data will be made public once peer-reviewed papers are published. We will explain this in the Letter of Information. 

# 16.1 Describe the process the investigator(s) will use to obtain informed consent from participants with the capacity to provide consent. For participants lacking capacity to consent see the question below.

Please include;

a) How participants will be informed of the study details prior to consenting (e.g. information letter via email, in-person by the researcher, reading letter online before a survey, etc.).

b) How consent will be documented (e.g. signed consent form, verbal consent log) or if there will be no documentation (e.g. online survey where proceeding with the survey implies consent).

c) Which member(s) of the research team will be handling the informed consent process, if applicable.

d) Any unique consent details, for example if the study involves consent in multiple stages or an ongoing consent process.

The information and consent to the study will be stated online before the survey starts and participants will take about 1-2 minutes to read it before starting the survey.  The survey won't begin until participants click to acknowledge and consent to terms. 

There will be no documentation of consent forms in the online survey.

# 16.9 Explain how participants will learn about study results:

We will provide a link where participants can follow our bulletins about our research publications and posts about what we learn from the data (independent of filling out the survey).  

__CS__ I was thinking of listing a link (e.g., github) on the Weebly page for whoever is intested in the study, instead of having them signing pu.  WDYT?

# 16.10.1 Describe:

a) how the participants will be informed that they can withdraw during the data collection process, and
b) the procedures which will be followed to allow participants to exercise this right.

It will be stated on the survey information and consent that the participation is voluntary and potential participants can choose to join the study at their own will.  They can also change their mind any time during the survey. They may stop answering questions at any point if wish not to proceed. 

# 16.10.2 For a participant who withdraws during the data collection process, describe:

a) what will be done with any data collected up to the point of withdrawal, and
b) consequences withdrawal might have on the participant, including any effect that withdrawal may have on the participant(s) incentive/reimbursement or continuation of services (if applicable).

Incomplete surveys will be discarded. There will be no consequences for withdrawal.

# 16.12 Explain why a participant cannot withdraw their data after it has been submitted/collected (e.g. data collection was anonymous).

It is an anonymous survey and the data collected is not traceable.
