# 3.4 How would you describe the research activity conducted in this protocol to a lay person unfamiliar 
with your discipline's methodologies and jargon? (max 250 words)?

The Covid-19 Awareness Study is a online anonymous survey conducted by McMaster University.   The study plans to collect data of the public's knowledge and responses 
to the COVID-19 outbreak.  The survey is open to participants.  The purpose of this study is 
to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is perceived by the public and their response to it. 
We hope the data will help us to better understand patterns of health knowledge and response 
to this crisis and to improve health communication flow during a crisis.

# 6.9 Provide the rationale for the exception to the community engagement requirement.

Race is part of our socio-demographic factor and we try to include as many races as possible.  
There is no emphasis on any racial background in this study and it will be questionable 
to exclude certain races from this study.
(This rationale of this answer was based on a question of this section:
6.2
The following statements are asked to determine whether community engagement is required. Check if applicable.
    > Recruitment criteria will include Canadian Indigenous identities as either a factor for the entire study or for a subgroup in the study)


# 8/1 Describe concisely and in plain language the study background of the proposed research project 
(e.g., context of the research, previous research, importance of this area of study, etc.).

COVID-19 pandemic has caused a serious international public health crisis. Understanding the 
public attitude and knowledge of the disease that may contribute to COVID-19 spread has the 
potential to improve the control of transmission of another infectious outbreak like this. 
The effect of public behaviour and the communication flow is especially crucial in the case of 
COVID-19 and has not yet been evaluated.  By knowing whether the public perception of the disease 
is align with the guidelines recommended by health authorities is necessary for the control of
disease outbreak.  This study will capture preliminary data necessary for modelling disease 
transmission and information flow.

# 8.2 Describe concisely and in plain language the specific purpose / research question for 
the proposed study.

The primary goal of this study is to characterize what COVID-19 knowledge the public has and the pattern of responses to the pandemic in relation to the government policy.  
There are three main questions in this proposed study:
What are people’s knowledge of COVID-19?
How do people respond to COVID-19?
How are people impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak?

# 9.1 What is the approximate number of participants required for this study? 
Where applicable, also provide a rationale for your choice in sample size 
and/or the sample size calculation (e.g., to explain how a low sample size 
will still provide meaningful results, or to justify the number of participants 
needed in research that includes significant risks).

We propose a sample size of 1000 online participants in finding a statistically reliable result.  
It will provide —% of power, and a margin of error of +/-—% and 95(?)% of confidence interval. 

# 9.2 What are the salient participant characteristics (e.g., age, gender, location, affiliation, etc.)? 
Describe any specific inclusion/exclusion criteria (e.g., BMI > 30, immigrated to Canada in the past year, etc.)

The survey is anonymous and will not collect any identifiable personal information.  The proposed study 
population is age 16 or older and has access to the online survey. No limitations will be placed on 
gender, race, health status or other socio-demographic factors.

# 10.1 How will each type of participant be recruited?

There will be no discrimination of recruitment except age and there is no specific type of participants 
for recruitment.  This survey investigators will post online on public platform of various social media 
with a link to the anonymous survey questionnaire. 

We expect to get participants via circulating and retweeting the recruitment message.

# 10.2 Who will recruit each type of participant?

The research team will post the recruitment message on social media and there is no exclusion of the 
potential participants except age (i.e., 16+) and internet access to the survey.

# 11.1 Describe sequentially, and in detail all data collection procedures in which the research participants will be involved (e.g., paper and pencil tasks, interviews, focus groups, lab experiments, participant observation, surveys, physical assessments etc. —this is not an exhaustive list). Include information about who will conduct the research (include tasks done by assistants, translators, transcriptionists etc.), how long it will take, where data collection will take place, and the ways in which data will be collected (e.g., computer responses, handwritten notes, audio/video/photo recordings etc.).

The study recruitment message will be circulate on social media and whoever view the message and are interested in this survey will proceed to the survey.  The potential participants will read the study summary and information and consent terms.  Once they decide to proceed and agree with the term (i.e. age 16 or older).  They will start the survey.  The potential participants are informed that they can stop the participation anytime during the survey.  When they complete the survey, the information they provide will be stored automatically and safely on cloud storage.  The whole survey will take about 15 minutes.

# 11.2 Describe your data analysis methods, (e.g. statistical analysis, textual analysis, NVIVO, etc.)?

Demographic variables will be analyzed with descriptive statistics.  Normally and non-normally distributed continuous variables will be analyzed as mean and standard deviation, and median and interquartile range respectively. Categorical variables will be calculated as counts and percentages.  The results will be presented as a proportion with a 95% confidence interval.

# 14.18 Discuss any potential benefits to the participants, scientific community and/or society that justify involvement of participants in this study.

Participants will not directly benefit from this study. However, we hope their participation will add to our knowledge to improve health communication and management during public health crises.

# 14.19 What is your experience with this kind of research? Include information on the experience of all individual(s) who will have contact with the research participants or their data. If this is student research, include the experience of your supervisor. Mention your familiarity with:

(a) the proposed methods
(b) the study population(s) and/or
(c) the research topic.

Dr. Shi holds a doctoral degree in media and communication study and had worked in advertising industry for many years. She is competent in conducting surveys.  Dr. She also obtained a certificate of TCPS2: Course on Research Ethics tutorial in 2020.
Dr. Dushoff and Dr. Earn are well trained statisticians and disease modellers and will supervise the study and data analysis. 
Dr. Li, a statistician, will be in charge of sampling and data analysis.

# 15.11.14 Describe the data security procedures that will be used to keep the research data private and secure during data collection and analysis (including where the data will be kept). Refer to the MREB Data Storage and Security Tools documents for recommendations and requirements for data security (go to Help - Templates in the above menu).

The TCPS2 advises that identifiable data obtained through research, and kept on a computer that is connected to the Internet, should be encrypted. Generally, MREB requires researchers to follow this guidance for identifiable research data. In some cases, sensitive identifiable data, even if not on a device connected to the Internet, may need to be encrypted to protect participant privacy and mitigate social risk. See the application section of Art. 5.3.

The electronic database will be stored on a password protected cloud storage.  All computer systems storing the data are encrypted and password protected.

# 15.19 How will the data from study participants be reported in the dissemination of research results (e.g., aggregated data, identifiable descriptors, de-identified descriptors, etc.)?

The data to be collected will be anonymous and no personal data will be identified.  We plan to analyze the aggregated data and publish results at peer reviewed publication.

# 15.23 State how long you plan to retain your research data (e.g., interview transcripts, survey answers, EEG readings, etc.).

The electronic database will be kept indefinitely.

# 15.24 Provide the rationale for the retention length of research data.

COVID-19 or another similar infectious outbreak is not unthinkable.  We expect to use the data for future comparison in the future if applied.

# 15.26 State at what point the data will be anonymized, or specify if the data was anonymous at the point of collection (e.g. an anonymous online survey).

This is an anonymous online survey.

# 15.36 Provide the details of sharing the data (e.g. the specific database), the rationale for making your raw data available, and describe the nature of the data that will be made available (e.g., identifiable or not, which variables).

Be sure to include these details in the Letter of Information so participants consent to this sharing of data. 

It will be only upon request by journals when we publish our results.  The data is anonymous and no identifiable information will be shown.

# 16.1 Describe the process the investigator(s) will use to obtain informed consent from participants with the capacity to provide consent. For participants lacking capacity to consent see the question below.

Please include;

a) How participants will be informed of the study details prior to consenting (e.g. information letter via email, in-person by the researcher, reading letter online before a survey, etc.).

b) How consent will be documented (e.g. signed consent form, verbal consent log) or if there will be no documentation (e.g. online survey where proceeding with the survey implies consent).

c) Which member(s) of the research team will be handling the informed consent process, if applicable.

d) Any unique consent details, for example if the study involves consent in multiple stages or an ongoing consent process.


The information and consent to the study will be addressed online before the survey starts and participants will take about 1-2 minutes to complete.  Consent to the study will be implemented online when potential participants read the recruitment message and click the consent button.  The survey won't begin without them acknowledged viewing the information and click the consent button.

There will be no documentation of consent forms in the online survey.

# 16.9 Explain how participants will learn about study results:

There will be statistics of the results post online.

# 16.10.1 Describe:

a) how the participants will be informed that they can withdraw during the data collection process, and
b) the procedures which will be followed to allow participants to exercise this right.

It will be stated on the recruitment message that the participation is voluntary and potential participants can choose to join the study at their own will.  They can also change their mind any time during the survey. They may stop answering questions at any point if wish not to proceed. 

# 16.10.2 For a participant who withdraws during the data collection process, describe:

a) what will be done with any data collected up to the point of withdrawal, and
b) consequences withdrawal might have on the participant, including any effect that withdrawal may have on the participant(s) incentive/reimbursement or continuation of services (if applicable).

Unfinished survey will be deemed as invalid and won't be counted.  There will be no consequences from withdrawing from the study anytime during the survey.

# 16.12 Explain why a participant cannot withdraw their data after it has been submitted/collected (e.g. data collection was anonymous).

It is an anonymous survey and the data collected is not traceable.
