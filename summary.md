## Research Aims/Questions

The proposed research will use modern statistical and contextual methods to study how information flows between forums, including scientific publications; governmental policies and agency; and mass and social media -- and investigate how it affects public perceptions and behaviours.
The project will be organized around three Research Questions:

- How does information (and misinformation) travel between scientists, public-health workers, mass media and social media? 
(Research sub-area ``cultural dimensions of the epidemic'') 

- How does communication affect public behaviour and the course of the outbreak? 
(Research sub-area ``public response'')

- How can scientists and policy-makers evaluate and improve the effectiveness of their communication?
(Research sub-area "strategies to combat misinformation'')
