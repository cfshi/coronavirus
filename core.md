Routes of communication: understanding the information flows that shape public and official reactions to COVID-19

# Project overview

Talk about the levels and the flows. Refer to Mike's diagram.

Talk broadly about sources

## Research questions:

(RQ1) How does information (and misinformation) travel between scientists, public-health workers, mass media and social media? (Research sub-area ``cultural dimensions of the epidemic'')

(RQ2) How does communication affect public behaviour and the course of the outbreak? (Research sub-area ``public health response'')

(RQ3) How can scientists and policy-makers evaluate and improve the effectiveness of their communication? (Research sub-area ``strategies to combat misinformation'')

## Data 

We will analyze

# Data and Sources: 
(ref theme analysis in the H1N1 paper, and PMID: 31956275)
Data published from November, 2019 to present (or one or two month after the outbreak waned)

- Newspaper will be collected from country of Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan (?), Canada and USA (and England?) based on the top circulation (either in English or Chinese)
- USA: Associated Press (AP) newswire; U.S. English-language newspapers of top high-circulation; most viewed youtube (and broadcast news transcripts from top networks?).  Lexis-Nexis will be used to collect texts from the first three sources, and the MIT MediaCloud database to collect texts from websites. Texts were collected from both sources using broad search terms \cite{LiuSieg19} ; and [World Journal](https://www.worldjournal.com/)
- Canada: (similar to USA), and [Sing Tao Daily](https://www.singtao.ca/toronto/?variant=zh-hk)
- Taiwan: the top x newspapers. https://www.ncl.edu.tw/.
- Hong Kong: [Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/gb/news415.htm),
- China:  [The People’s Daily English](http://en.people.cn/), [The People’s Daily English](http://www.people.com.cn/), [China Daily](http://global.chinadaily.com.cn/)		- Singapore
- Japan: [Japanese Times](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/)
- Twitter: (CS:  How does it work internationally outside Canada and USA?).  It will be great if we can have social media (instgram or FB in Taiwan, Singapore etc)

* Main newspapers in China and their official health bureau websites are included for analysis but not social media.   Social media such as twitter and Facebook are barred in China. Yet, there are information and coverage about the outbreak inside China in the media we analyze either from direct interview or re-twittes. 

- Google Trend database.  Google Trends provides search around the world by region and county.  Research showed that Google Trend can be influenced by the media attraction than by true epidemiological burden \cite{}, yet more evidences suggested that it reflects awareness-related burst of searches \cite{BousAgac17, MahrBrag19}
-   By analyzing google trends data, the daily infected cases and fatality and frequency of media coverage,  we use Google Search Trends and media coverage as a proxy indicator for information dissemination and public reaction  (https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3536663).
- e.g. https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%201-m&geo=SG&q=%2Fm%2F01cpyy,wuhan%20virus,19-nCov,sars,flu ,([export google trend data]( https://support.google.com/trends/answer/4365538?hl=en)
- Google Trend data can be very confusing, for [example](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%201-m&geo=TW&gprop=images&q=coronavirus,sars,%2Fm%2F0l3cy,wuhan%20virus,%E6%AD%A6%E6%BC%A2%E8%82%BA%E7%82%8E)): Why would Wuhan topped coronavirus and 武漢肺炎 in Taiwan?
- Science community report Ro of the virus transmission.  Science publication: preprint (by searching Google Scholar, arXiv, bioRxiv, medRxiv, and SSRN) and peer-reviewed (by search Google Schoolar, PubMed, Embase, Medline, and OVID)
- The epidemic findings from science community is part of the information the public, media and international community rely on. They play a powerful role during public health crises due to the time urgency with which they can disseminate new information, accurate or not. (ref: [Early in the Epidemic: Impact of preprints on global discourse of 2019-nCoV transmissibility](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3536663)).  We can also check findings of preprint (speedy information delivery, lack of peer review) in terms of accuracy and how misinformation get circulated based on those findings. (see [examples](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3536663))
- (CS’s confusion: Is context same as noise in modelling (e.g., Park and Dushoff 2020):  dynamical or process; noise(randomness directly or indirectly affecting disease transmission); observation noise(randomness underlying how many true cases reported).  Based on their definition, how do context or media, public reaction and pubic policy-guideline fit into models?  Is it a right question?)
- (CS: It will be good to incorporate modelling ideas in this project but WHAT?  Also, how workable is it to compare this coronavirus to 2012 MERS and 2002 SARS in terms of the spread and reaction context ?)
- Official health websites:  WHO, [US CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/index.html), [National Health Commission of PRC](http://en.nhc.gov.cn/index.html), [Canada PHAC](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection.html), [Taiwan CDC](https://www.cdc.gov.tw/En), [Singapore CDC](https://www.ncid.sg/Pages/default.aspx), [Hong Kong CDC]().  We will include the disease control and prevention centre in Japan later if 

* We will add sources (e.g., [Central China Normal Univeristy](http://news.ccnu.edu.cn/index.htm), []Wuhan University(https://www.whu.edu.cn/xxfy/) etc for our contextual analysis.

# Methods:
-  Data mining:
* textual analysis of news media and Twitter are implemented by AI based on coding book which will be based on a pilot study.  The findings of textual analysis 
- Human Coders and AI (?):  
- (fill in what it is about	)
- ( fill in sentences on AI part)
- (fill in sentences on coders)
- The textual analysis will be conducted based on a coding book we will draft when the funding is approved.  The coding book should list themes and frames for analyzing the texts, which will be categorized based on a pilot study as part of drawing the coding book.  The basic structure of the themes will outline what (e.g. ), in addition to information types  (e.g., news, information and misinformation/fake news based on sources: verified, anonymous, speculation), who (e.g. active vs. passive subject), where (e.g., country, region and city), and theme tone (e.g., negative, positive, neutral).  (see  attached [Basic Coding frame](https://github.com/cfshi/coronavirus/blob/master/coding%20book.md) for what themes are like)
- Contextual analysis by researchers
- (fill in what contextual analysis is)
-   How media content and information are framed are often socially and politically cultivated \cite{}.  We will  implement contextual analyses of the quantitative findings and elaborate how information is framed and disseminated in this uncertain circumstances into context.
- summarizing and comparing policy, guidelines and recommendation by national and international health organizations.
- modelling (Can we do this?_:  incorporating media coverage, public and institutional reaction and report (which can be based on modelling results by scientific community and WHO etc), time travelling and spread network (geographical)

* key words search for Google trend analysis, and official public health websites: coronavirus, 19-nCov, COVID-19, influenza, 武疫 (Wu Virus)，武漢病毒 (Wuhan Virus)，武漢(Wuhan)，武漢肺炎 (Wuhan pneumonia)，肺炎 (pneumonia)，冠状病毒 (coronavirus), 新型冠状病毒 (novel coronavirus), 武漢新型冠状病毒 (Wuhan novel coronavirus)
-  general public:
- Data:  travel, [movies](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/?ref_=bo_nb_di_mojologo), restaurants in Taiwan, Singapore, H.K., Canada and USA; or should we focus on North America and on travel and [movie box office](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/?ref_=bo_nb_di_mojologo)?
