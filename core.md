## Chyun's version

Effective health communication, including dissemination of good information and countering misinformation, is key to outbreak management \citep{SongSong17} and consistent recommendation \citep{OhlrSugg18,SongSong17}.
We will use techniques (guidelines?) from content analysis to combine (compile?) \citep{Finf13 ,Mayr14}results from our analysis techniques (textual and modelling anlaysis?) to formulate hypotheses about what factors lead to effective communication. In particular, we will identify cases where good information did or did not out-compete bad information. When information from public-health agencies spreads effectively we will also evaluate our behavioural proxies to ask when it led to a calibrated reaction from the public (as opposed to over- or under-reaction).  A cultural and social approach will also be applied in interpreting the data results to outline how cultural and social communication can be incorporated into health communication strategies.  We will make use of previous studies to evaluate \citep{Ding14,FarmSher18,NowaShee15,Tam18} and develop \citep{BekaBigm18, ShenShee15, SongSong17} strategies for effective health communication.
