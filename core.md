## New material: effective communicaiton

Effective health communication is needed to improve health behaviour and prevent disease outbreak \citep{OhlrSugg18}; that involves, for instance, a response system that includes provision and dissemination of reliable information and inhibits online diffusion of false information \citep{SongSong17} and consistent recommendation \citep{OhlrSugg18}  .  Factors of effective strategies of health communication includes, for examples, narratives and media platform \citep{BekaBigm18, ShenShee15, SongSong17}, interaction between mood and information \citep{SarRodg19}, and cultural beliefs \citep{LuLuo19}. 
We will refer our findings of communication flow with the COVID-19 outbreak to evidence-based studies for guideline to propose measurement of effective communication to slow a emergent influenza outbreak for the current COVID-19 or for a future pandemic.
