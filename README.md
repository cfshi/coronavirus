# Title
Mapping Coronavirus (19-nCoV) outbreak timeline, media coverage and public and national and international reaction and guidlines
(It's very brief.  I would like to have modeling ideas in this project but WHAT???)

# Working Time Table
2/5:  registration

3/4:  proposal due

# Research Questions:
The questions are tenative and brief.
- How media coverage, public reaction, health institutes interplay the coronavirus spread?
- How modeling predictions (from scientifc communinity) are produced and used?
- How norm (e.g., social sanction) correlate with health behavior in contributing/reducing/avoding the infection?
- Modeling the outbreak with media (and other factors) in the model

# Method
* Media:
  - twitter:  using "Using Twitter search network API, tweets with "flu" keyword were collected and tabulated. Network centralities were calculated with network analysis tool, NodeXL. The collected Twitters accounts were content analyzed and categorized by multiple coders." (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27185510, YunMori16)
  
  - Popular data sources included Twitter, Reddit, various online health communities, and Facebook.
