# Title
Mapping Coronavirus (19-nCoV) outbreak timeline, media coverage and public and national and international reaction and guidlines
(It's very brief.  (I would like to have modeling ideas in this project but WHAT???  Also, how workable is it to compare this coronavirus to 2012 MERS and 2002 SARS in terms of the spread and reaction context (media coverage, public and institutional reaction and modeling prediction?)

# Working Time Table
2/5:  registration

3/4:  proposal due

# Research Questions:

Studyig spreading route.  E.g., From Wuhan to Taipei:  flight route, how many people got contacted and when the report/tract stu
The questions are tenative and brief.  One main challenge is how to conbime J's expertize and mine.  I.e., media analyais, media impacts, public reaction, policy update and disease transmission pattern/route.  

- How media coverage, public reaction, health institutes interplay the coronavirus spread?
- How modeling predictions (from scientifc communinity) are produced and used?
- How norm (e.g., social sanction) correlate with health behavior in contributing/reducing/avoding the infection?
- Modeling the outbreak with media (and other factors) in the model
- How does the 19-nCoV different from 2012 MERS-CoV and 2002 SARS-CoV?  This is a big question and I don't know if it's workable.

# Collaborators
- China
- Taiwan (get names from J; find someone who does media study)
- H.K.
- England (Chng Nai Rui)
- USA
- Japan and Korea?

# Method
* Media: (big data mining?)
  - twitter:  using "Using Twitter search network API, tweets with "flu" keyword were collected and tabulated. Network centralities were calculated with network analysis tool, NodeXL. The collected Twitters accounts were content analyzed and categorized by multiple coders." (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27185510, YunMori16)
  
  - Popular data sources included Twitter, Reddit, various online health communities, and Facebook.

* modeling:  incorporating media coverage, public and institutional reaction and report (which can be based on modeling resutls by scientific community and WHO etc), time travelling and spread network (geographical)
