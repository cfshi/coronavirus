# Title
Mapping Coronavirus (19-nCoV) outbreak timeline, media coverage and public and national and international reaction and guidlines
(It's very brief.  (I would like to have modeling ideas in this project but WHAT???  Also, how workable is it to compare this coronavirus to 2012 MERS and 2002 SARS in terms of the spread and reaction context (media coverage, public and institutional reaction and modeling prediction?)

# Working Time Table


# Main Context (guidance, warning, policy of prevention and treatment)
- quarantine of suspected and infected individuals
- quarantine of cities (e.g. Wuhan no exit/entry); 
- travel restriction:  banning flights; banning visitors, 
- airport screening (temperature)
- wearing masks (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-masks-safety/to-mask-or-not-to-mask-confusion-spreads-over-coronavirus-protection-idUSKBN1ZU0PH, 
- countries evacuating their citizens out of Wuhan via aircrafts

Is context same as noise in modeling (e.g., Park and Dushoff 2020):  dynamical or process; noise(randomness directly or indirectly affecting disease transmission); observation noise(randomness underlying how many true caases reported).  Based on their definion, how do context or media, public reation and pubic policy-guideline fit into models?  Is it a right question?


# Research Questions:

To study the following factors and incorporate them all in a model to map a transmission route/pattern of infectious disease (19-nCov/Wuhan virus in this case): media (mass and social) coverage, public (from media content, or?)reaction, institutional decision (goverments and WHO etc) and transmission speed/region/scales.   

Regarding spreading route, e.g., from Wuhan to Taipei:  flight route, how many people got infected and whom they contacted.  We will need data from governments (e.g., Taiwan CDC)

Regarding media content, we may do data mining to collect media content from big data base and do data mining (or not?).
WHO reaction was politicalized.  The chairman, who is Ethiopia, first commented that China was efficient and did a good job curtailing the virus; that was different from common belief.  Did the WHO's position delay the world's reaction to the virus?

"This case report highlights the importance of clinicians eliciting a recent history of travel or exposure to sick contacts in any patient presenting for medical care with acute illness symptoms, in order to ensure appropriate identification and prompt isolation of patients who may be at risk for 2019-nCoV infection and to help reduce further transmission. Finally, this report highlights the need to determine the full spectrum and natural history of clinical disease, pathogenesis, and duration of viral shedding associated with 2019-nCoV infection to inform clinical management and public health decision making." \cite{HolsDebo20}

The questions are tenative and brief.  One main challenge is how to conbime J's expertize and mine.  I.e., media analyais, media impacts, public reaction, policy update and disease transmission pattern/route.  

- How media coverage, public reaction, health institutes interplay the coronavirus spread?
- How modeling predictions (from scientifc communinity) are produced and used?
- How norm (e.g., social sanction) correlate with health behavior in contributing/reducing/avoding the infection?
- Modeling the outbreak with media (and other factors) in the model
- How does the 19-nCoV different from 2012 MERS-CoV and 2002 SARS-CoV?  This is a big question and I don't know if it's workable.

Another perspective will be summarize, compare and analysis of international reaction and pulbic policy:

- media report
- cases:  by countries, region
- policy:  quarentine, flight control, boarder control, hospital preparation, sources distributin (mask etc)
- WHO position:  from day 1 till now
- economic impact (maybe not this one)
Based on our findigs to propose for preparation and recommmendation for future outbreak (or even this 19-nCov)

# Collaborators
- China
- Taiwan (get names from J; find someone who does media study)
- H.K.
- England (Chng Nai Rui)
- USA
- Japan and Korea?

# Method
* big data mining for media?
  - twitter:  using "Using Twitter search network API, tweets with "flu" keyword were collected and tabulated. Network centralities were calculated with network analysis tool, NodeXL. The collected Twitters accounts were content analyzed and categorized by multiple coders." (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27185510, YunMori16)
  
  - Popular data sources included Twitter, Reddit, various online health communities, and Facebook.

* modeling:  incorporating media coverage, public and institutional reaction and report (which can be based on modeling resutls by scientific community and WHO etc), time travelling and spread network (geographical)
