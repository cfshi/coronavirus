Or special coronavirus call: https://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/51868.html (due Feb 17!!!)
- Social and policy countermeasures research:
- Cultural dimensions of the epidemic such as, examining how individuals and communities understand and react to the disease;
- Studying the public health response;
- Developing strategies to combat misinformation, stigma, and fear;
- Studying logistical (e.g., infrastructure, transport, evacuation) and economic impacts;
- Studying international relations, global coordination, response systems and crisis management; and
- Considering the social dynamics of transmission.

# Title

Logistic analysis of 2020 coronavirus spread:  media coverage and dissemination, public-governmental-international 
understanding and reaction, and national and international guidelines.

# Working Time Table


# Main Context (guidance, warning, policy of prevention and treatment)
- quarantine of suspected and infected individuals
- quarantine of cities (e.g. Wuhan no exit/entry); 
- travel restriction:  banning flights; banning visitors, 
- airport screening (temperature)
- wearing masks (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-masks-safety/to-mask-or-not-to-mask-confusion-spreads-over-coronavirus-protection-idUSKBN1ZU0PH, 
- countries evacuating their citizens out of Wuhan via aircrafts

Is context same as noise in modelling (e.g., Park and Dushoff 2020):  dynamical or process; noise(randomness directly or indirectly affecting disease transmission); observation noise(randomness underlying how many true cases reported).  Based on their definition, how do context or media, public reaction and pubic policy-guideline fit into models?  Is it a right question?


# Research Questions:

To study the following factors and incorporate them all in a model to map a transmission route/pattern of infectious disease (19-nCov/Wuhan virus in this case): media (mass and social) coverage, public (from media content, or?)reaction, institutional decision (governments and WHO etc) and transmission speed/region/scales.   

Regarding spreading route, e.g., from Wuhan to Taipei:  flight route, how many people got infected and whom they contacted.  We will need data from governments (e.g., Taiwan CDC)

Regarding media content, we may do data mining to collect media content from big data base and do data mining (or not?).
WHO reaction was politicalized.  The chairman, who is Ethiopia, first commented that China was efficient and did a good job curtailing the virus; that was different from common belief.  Did the WHO's position delay the world's reaction to the virus?

"This case report highlights the importance of clinicians eliciting a recent history of travel or exposure to sick contacts in any patient presenting for medical care with acute illness symptoms, in order to ensure appropriate identification and prompt isolation of patients who may be at risk for 2019-nCoV infection and to help reduce further transmission. Finally, this report highlights the need to determine the full spectrum and natural history of clinical disease, pathogenesis, and duration of viral shedding associated with 2019-nCoV infection to inform clinical management and public health decision making." \cite{HolsDebo20}

The questions are tetative and brief.  One main challenge is how to combine J's expertise and mine.  I.e., media analysis, media impacts, public reaction, policy update and disease transmission pattern/route.  

- How media coverage, public reaction, health institutes interplay the coronavirus spread?
	— We will need to work on theme for content analysis, either quantitative (via computer) or qualitative
	— Media content can present a picture of what was communicated among the public, the government and the international communities.  It gives story of what was the virus like and how it was perceived.
- How policy correlate with health behavior in contributing/reducing/avoiding the infection?
	— This is important.  We will compare what policies imposed by selected countries  to contain and prevent the spread of the infection and its progress.  This will allow us to propose recommendation for future outbreak (or even this one).
	— We will go to official website (also media content?) such as WHO, US CDC etc for information.
	— Although WHO position in the beginning of the virus spread was questioned (https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/chinese-officials-note-serious-problems-in-coronavirus-response-the-world-health-organization-keeps-praising-them/2020/02/08/b663dd7c-4834-11ea-91ab-ce439aa5c7c1_story.html) , how to interpret WHO information and recommendation	need to be cautious.  So what does it mean?  How do we use their info?
- How people react to the virus?  
	— We will use google trend (by countries, time and categories) and the daily infected cases and fatality (via WHO?) and study the correlation of the two patterns.
	— focus on social anxiety and racism?

- How does the 19-nCoV different from 2012 MERS-CoV and 2002 SARS-CoV?  This is a big question and I don't know if it's workable.
- Modelling the outbreak with media (and other factors) in the model
- How modelling predictions (from scientific community) are produced and used? (maybe this is outside the scope of this proposal)
	— comparing modelling prediction 
Another perspective will be summarize, compare and analysis of international reaction and public policy:

- media report
- cases:  by countries, region
- policy:  quarantine, flight control, boarder control, hospital preparation, sources distribution (mask etc)
- WHO position:  from day 1 till now
- economic impact (maybe not this one)
Based on our findings to propose for preparation and recommendation for future outbreak (or even this 19-nCov)

# Method
* big data mining for media?
  - twitter:  using "Using Twitter search network API, tweets with "flu" keyword were collected and tabulated. Network centralities were calculated with network analysis tool, NodeXL. The collected Twitters accounts were content analyzed and categorized by multiple coders." (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27185510, YunMori16)

# Background:
China alerted WHO on December 31, 2019 to several cases of pneumonia in Wuhan, a port city of 11 million people in the central Hubei province. The virus was unknown.
On January 7th, according to the WHO, China announced they had identified a new virus named 2019-nCoV or novel coronavirus, identified as belonging to the coronavirus family, which includes SARS and common cold. It originates from mammals and attacks the respiratory system, and individuals affected can feel symptoms from mild cold to severe disease and death.  “Coronaviruses spread through being in proximity to an infected person and inhaling droplets generated 
when they cough or sneeze, or touching a surface where these droplets land and then touching one's face or nose."  The first death was announced on January 11th in Chia.
Since then, the virus was reported in Thailand, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, Philippine, United States, Germany and many other countries (up to xx at the writing)
By February 9th, the death toll reached to over 800 cases, passed the fatality caused by 2002-3 SARS.  There were xxx confirmed cases and d xxx death in worldwide (cite) and xxx and xxx respectively in China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/xcs/yqtb/202002/4a611bc7fa20411f8ba1c8084426c0d4.shtml,) by Feb xx.  Five million people left Wuhan before the city shut down (https://www.businessinsider.com/wuhan-coronavirus-officials-quarantine-entire-city-2020-10 ).  One of the challenges in containing the outbreak is that a substantial fraction of infected people show only mild symptoms (https://www.businessinsider.com/wuhan-coronavirus-officials-quarantine-entire-city-2020-1)

Public anxiety and fear rises when public health threats are not contained (cite).  With no vaccine treatment, no he 2019-nCov
