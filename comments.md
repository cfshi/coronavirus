- L48 Just an addition example (not very important)

There are reports of bias against Chinese people in social media and in news reports. Could be cited here.

- L59 more examples (I don't think we need) and I added text I think is useful in already (see mli comments)

- L90 trivial fill in the black, I added this already.

- L108 More detail about textual analysis I don't know how to add. I added the comment in content.tex. 

- L109 Suggest adding Mask and hanitizer sales data and how they are good in providing info on public response. (I know it is useful but I don't think we should mention or say it unless we know we can get the data). 

- L114 Naveed is not clear about the Dynamical modeling section and how it will link back with the other theme.

- 132 Deliverables: Software (This is section is currently blank). Describe what kind of software. I was envisioning a tool that runs on Twitter stream data and classifies tweets based on contents as well as significance in terms of influence ( how much it has potential to spread based on following network or influencer.  
See paper for classification of influencers. https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-019-6747-8

Flow diagram: Does the media not influence policymakers? 
They may not want to admit it, but I bet it does.  
Reality might contain a dashed arrow from Media to Policymaker.  
Evidence for such effects is something that the methodology could address perhaps.

Obviously the later sections and figure captions need a lot of        + attention.
